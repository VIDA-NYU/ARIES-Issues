# ARIES - ARt Image Exploration Space

Art historians have traditionally used physical light boxes to prepare exhibits or curate collections. On a light box, they can place slides or printed images, move the images around at will, group them as desired, and visually compare them. The transition to digital images has rendered this workflow obsolete. Now, art historians lack well-designed, unified interactive software tools that effectively support the operations they perform with physical light boxes. 

To address this problem, we designed **ARIES - ARt Image Exploration Space**, an interactive image manipulation system that enables the exploration and organization of fine digital art. The system allows images to be compared in multiple ways, offering dynamic overlays analogous to a physical light box, and supporting advanced image comparisons and feature-matching functions, available through computational image processing. 

ARIES was presented in the <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/cg/2018/01/mcg2018010091-abs.html">paper</a>:
